Project Report

We made a study group app for the project, where you can plan study group meetings with other users of the app. You can specify a group name, subject, time, location, and description when creating a group. You can filter the groups that appear based on those attributes.  You can also delete groups and edit them if you were the one who created them.  To join a group, you press the rsvp button and it is added to your list of saved groups.  The project uses the flutter android framework.  We use google firebase database services to store existing groups and send them to the clients.  We also use it to authenticate users.  There are different tabs in the UI for available groups, groups you’ve joined, and a tab for managing and deleting groups you’ve created.
Ryan did the sending and receiving of study groups from firebase, and saving data locally to the client for persistent storage.  Conrad did user authentication and sign-in.  Rashin did the UI and filtering of available study groups by their attributes.
